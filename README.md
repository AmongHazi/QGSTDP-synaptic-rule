QGSTDP: A biologically inspired synaptic modulation rule for spiking neural network

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a promising paradigm for energy-efficient, brain-inspired computing. Nevertheless, a gap remains between current bio-inspired learning rules and the objective of attaining both biological plausibility and computational efficiency. To address this, we propose a Q-learning-gated and Gaussian-inspired Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (QGSTDP) rule. The QGSTDP employs local modulation by Gaussian-inspired Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (GSTDP) rule, which simulates the influence of action potentials in postsynaptic neurons from neurotransmitters. The QGSTDP implements global modulation of metaplasticity through second-order control via Q-learning. The dual-level plasticity rule enables SNNs to efficiently optimize synaptic weights, yielding higher accuracy on benchmark datasets without extensive training samples. We validated the proposed method on three benchmark datasets: MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in achieving better performance.
